# TrainScheduler - Hogwarts Express  

Train Scheduler, with a hogwarts twist, is an application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data inputed by a user. It retrieves and manipulates this stored information with Moment.js. It provides up-to-date information about various trains, their arrival times and how many minutes until the next arrival at their station.
